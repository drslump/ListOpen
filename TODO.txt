X Module for custom url scheme and global key trigger
    - Compile module
    - Place xxx.dylib in /Library/Application Support/Titanium/modules/osx/tiXXXX/1.2.0RC4/
    - Update 'manifest' file to include the new module: 'tiXXXX:1.2.0RC4

- Linux
  - Path scan: A notorious thing about linux is that it uses a cache for ls, thus subsequent operations
    are incredibly faster (http://www.linuxinsight.com/proc_sys_vm_drop_caches.html)

- Paths are repeated continuosly, perhaps we can optimize memory usage for large lists by:
  - Start the value with a symbol (^) which gets replaced by the path of the item just above
    - Store paths in the list and use the relative symbols
  - Keep two separate lists, one stores paths and the other filenames. The JS engine should cache
    repeated strings efficiently and would avoid having to look back to find the previous path.
    TODO: WebKit doesn't seem to work like Chrome, equal strings take up space :(

- Modify lionbars.js to adjust dynamically to the changing size of the list

- Implement scoring loop as a C++ module?

- Score based on how frequently an item is selected? store this data somewhere?

- Tray icon allows to choose default list/editor for when triggered without params

- Find a way (maybe 3rd-party tool) to trigger it with a global shortcut

- Cross platform

  - We can also use a Titanium.Network.TCPServerSocket (or HTTPServer) and use simple shell scripts
    to send the new commands. This has the advantatge of not needing a C++ module since everything
    could be done with Titanium JS and shell scripts

    X Restore focus to previous window with wscript and SendKeys('%{TAB}')
      Resolution: Window.hide() seems to do this automatically

    X Dir command is very slow on mounted paths (smb, network, vmware shares, etc.)
      The ls port by utools.com (http://utools.com/msls.app) performs very well in those cases and 
      also on local paths.
      The ls.exe binary can be bundled with the application and be used as the preferred method. 
      Advanced users can use a configuration option to switch to the "dir" scanner.
      Resolution: msls binary is bundled and used in windows.

  - On Linux
    - Launch by Custom URL Protocol + DBus, dbus-send cli ?
    - http://developer.pidgin.im/wiki/DbusHowto

    X Restore focus with xwit / wmctrl ?
      Resolution: Window.hide() seems to do this automatically

	- Window transparency only seems to work with an accelerated desktop (ie: Unity), otherwise
	  a black background is shown. So we might need a custom theme for Linux that is "squared"
	  and fine tune the UI window size to match the contents. 

- Create chrome/firefox extension for tabs/history to showcase that it's not only for paths

- Load configuration (check extra/config.ini)

- For the path matcher, check for a ".listopen" at the root (or scan backwards) to read customization
  properties from it

- Allow configurable "prefixes" (ie: v:, contr:), they limit the search to files matching a user
  defined regexp.

X Check http://cocoatutorial.grapewave.com/2010/01/creating-a-status-bar-application/
  By modifying the generated Info.plist we can hide the app menu and icon in the dock

X Allow to select multiple items (drawer? just from the current list? space to select?)

X Cmd+N selects the N entry in the list

- List from ctags file

- List from simple file with paths

- Left/Right arrows with empty text navigate thru previous searches for the same path?

- Launching without list/path show MRU lists

- Themes are just simple CSS files
